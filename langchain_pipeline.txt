Explanation of the Example:

Initialize the LLM:
This step instantiates a Language Model, in this case, OpenAI. You would configure it with your API key or other necessary parameters.

Define a Prompt Template:
A PromptTemplate defines the structure of the input that will be sent to the LLM. It allows for dynamic insertion of variables (like question in this example) into a pre-defined template string.

Create an LLMChain:
An LLMChain combines an LLM and a Prompt Template. When invoked, it takes the input variables, formats them according to the template, and sends the resulting prompt to the LLM for completion.

Invoke the Chain:
The run() method of the LLMChain executes the pipeline. It takes the input (the question in this case), passes it through the prompt template, sends the formatted prompt to the LLM, and returns the LLM's generated response.

Key Concepts in LangChain Pipelines:

Chains:
Sequences of calls, either to LLMs or other utilities, that process data in a defined order.

Prompt Templates:
Reusable structures for constructing prompts with dynamic input variables.

LLMs:
The large language models that perform the core text generation or understanding tasks.

Memory (Optional):
For conversational agents, memory components can be integrated to maintain context across multiple turns of interaction.

Retrievers (for RAG):
In Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, retrievers fetch relevant information from external data sources (e.g., vector databases) to augment the LLM's knowledge.

Agents:
More advanced constructs that use LLMs to decide which tools to use and in what order to achieve a goal, often involving multiple steps and external interactions.
