## ⚡ What you might still be slightly missing (to get a complete “foundation” picture):

Memory in LangChain → how agents remember past interactions

Retrieval (RAG) → how LLMs fetch external knowledge (DB + embeddings)

Chains beyond LLMChain → like SequentialChain, RetrievalQA

Basic Deployment view → where all this fits (API, container, infra)
