✅ LangChain basics – what it is, how it integrates with LLMs
✅ Gemini with LangChain – using Google’s LLM via LangChain
✅ MCP (Model Context Protocol) – how it works, why it matters
✅ AI infra & terminology – VMs, architecture, infra-related terms
✅ LLMChain – the simplest LangChain chain (prompt → response)
✅ Agentic framework vs LLM framework – difference in workflows
✅ Code practice – creating an agent with a tool (Tavily search)
✅ Virtual Machine basics – architecture + why used in AI setups

##⚡ What you might still be slightly missing (to get a complete “foundation” picture):

Memory in LangChain → how agents remember past interactions

Retrieval (RAG) → how LLMs fetch external knowledge (DB + embeddings)

Chains beyond LLMChain → like SequentialChain, RetrievalQA

Basic Deployment view → where all this fits (API, container, infra)
