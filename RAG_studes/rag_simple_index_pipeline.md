# Whatever is done in the code here - understood 
so 
split , txt_splitter -> builds chuncks of chars (Building agents with LLM...)

then it's vecdb number
(0.12,0.2,0.08.....0.12)

then convert to FAISS means 
after combining all these numbers which r vectors i.e embeddings into one dic / list then assigning the index numbers from 0 to infinity 

then it is stored again in the vecdb after assigning and combination and then 
as per user query it will retieve the information with the usage of indexing and comparing if the numbers i.e vectors are similary to user's q and the knowledge base it has 

<h3>For hub.pull(...) → no API key needed.

<h3>For llm.invoke(...) → yes, API key needed (depends on which LLM provider you’re using).
